Create a GitHub repository called “st2195_assignment_8” and include the following
Python scripts:
1. assignment_8_1.ipynb to replicate assignment 7 in Python [5 points]
2. assignment_8_2.ipynb to describe the latest bilateral trade data for the G7 (this
aggregate can be computed using bilateral imports and exports data available on
the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics) with the three network graphical
representations in the module on network visualisation [2.5 points]
3. assignment_8_3.ipynb to repeat the second bullet point using one year ago data
and compare the output with the latest results using a 3x2 subplot containing all
